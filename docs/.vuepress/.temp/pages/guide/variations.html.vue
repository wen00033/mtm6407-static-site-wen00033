<ul>
<li><em>one card split aces</em>: a single new card is added to each Ace and the turn ends. They are thus regarded as 11-point cards. No other denomination is subject to this process.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>early surrender</em>: player has the option to surrender before dealer checks for Blackjack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>late surrender</em>: player has the option to surrender after dealer checks for Blackjack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>double-down restrictions</em>: double-down allowed only on certain combinations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>dealer hits a soft seventeen</em> (ace-six, which can play as seven or seventeen)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>European No-Hole-Card Rule</em>: the dealer receives only one card, dealt face-up, and does not receive a second card (and thus does not check for blackjack) until players have acted. This means players lose not only their original bet, but also any additional money invested from splitting and doubling down. A game that has no-hole-card doesn't necessarily mean you will lose additional bets as well as original bets. In Australia for example, a player beaten by a dealer blackjack may keep all split and double bets and lose only the original bet, thus the game plays the same as it would if there were a hole card.</p>
