<p>A two-card hand of <strong>21</strong> (an ace plus a ten-value card) is called a <strong>blackjack</strong> or a <strong>natural</strong>, and is an automatic winner. A player with a natural is usually paid <strong>3:2</strong> on his bet. In 2003 some casinos started paying only <strong>6:5</strong> on blackjacks; although this reduced payout has generally been restricted to single-deck games where card counting would otherwise be a viable strategy, the move was decried by longtime blackjack players.</p>
<h4 id="the-play-goes-as-follows" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-play-goes-as-follows" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The play goes as follows:</h4>
<ol>
<li>If the dealer has blackjack and the player doesn't, the player automatically loses.</li>
<li>If the player has blackjack and the dealer doesn't, the player automatically wins.</li>
<li>If both the player and dealer have blackjack then it's a push.</li>
<li>If neither side has blackjack, then each player plays out his hand, one at a time.</li>
<li>When all the players have finished the dealer plays his hand.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Hit</em>: Take another card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Stand</em>: Take no more cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Double</em> down: Double the wager, take exactly one more card, and then stand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Split</em>: Double the wager and have each card be the first card in a new hand.
<em>This option is available only when both cards have the same value. Sometimes two face cards will be considered acceptable for splitting, as each is 10 points.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Surrender</em>: Forfeit half the bet and give up the hand. Surrender was common during the early- and mid-20th century, but is no longer offered at most casinos.</p>
</li>
</ul>
