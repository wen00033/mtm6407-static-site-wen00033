A player with a natural is usually paid <strong>3:2</strong> on his bet. In 2003 some casinos started paying only <strong>6:5</strong> on blackjacks; although this reduced payout has generally been restricted to single-deck games where card counting would otherwise be a viable strategy, the move was decried by longtime blackjack players.</p><h4 id="the-play-goes-as-follows" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-play-goes-as-follows" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The play goes as follows:</h4><ol><li>If the dealer has blackjack and the player doesn&#39;t, the player automatically loses.</li><li>If the player has blackjack and the dealer doesn&#39;t, the player automatically wins.</li><li>If both the player and dealer have blackjack then it&#39;s a push.</li><li>If neither side has blackjack, then each player plays out his hand, one at a time.</li><li>When all the players have finished the dealer plays his hand.</li></ol><h4 id="the-player-s-options-for-playing-his-or-her-hand-are" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-player-s-options-for-playing-his-or-her-hand-are" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The player&#39;s options for playing his or her hand are:</h4><ul><li><p><em>Hit</em>: Take another card.</p></li><li><p><em>Stand</em>: Take no more cards.</p></li><li><p><em>Double</em> down: Double the wager, take exactly one more card, and then stand.</p></li><li><p><em>Split</em>: Double the wager and have each card be the first card in a new hand. <em>This option is available only when both cards have the same value.
