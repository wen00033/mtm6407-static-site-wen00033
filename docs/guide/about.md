# Let's begin this game ðŸ¤“

A two-card hand of **21** (an ace plus a ten-value card) is called a **blackjack** or a **natural**, and is an automatic winner. A player with a natural is usually paid **3:2** on his bet. In 2003 some casinos started paying only **6:5** on blackjacks; although this reduced payout has generally been restricted to single-deck games where card counting would otherwise be a viable strategy, the move was decried by longtime blackjack players.

#### The play goes as follows:

1. If the dealer has blackjack and the player doesn't, the player automatically loses.
2. If the player has blackjack and the dealer doesn't, the player automatically wins.
3. If both the player and dealer have blackjack then it's a push.
4. If neither side has blackjack, then each player plays out his hand, one at a time.
5. When all the players have finished the dealer plays his hand.

#### The player's options for playing his or her hand are:

- _Hit_: Take another card.
- _Stand_: Take no more cards.
- _Double_ down: Double the wager, take exactly one more card, and then stand.
- _Split_: Double the wager and have each card be the first card in a new hand.
  _This option is available only when both cards have the same value. Sometimes two face cards will be considered acceptable for splitting, as each is 10 points._

- _Surrender_: Forfeit half the bet and give up the hand. Surrender was common during the early- and mid-20th century, but is no longer offered at most casinos.
